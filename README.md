# Bio-Inspired-Optimization-Algorithms
Implementations of Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm and Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm.
# Genetic Algorithm
The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic algorithm which has been inspired by the process of natural selection (darwinism). In the code, we attempt to optimise a string to a particular target string strating with a population of random strings.
# Particle Swarm Optimization 
The Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is also a metaheuristic algorithm. It has been inspired by the movement of a flock of birds or a school of fish. It is based on the concept of Swarm Intelligence. PSO does not use the gradient for optimising the fitness function. Thus, it does not require the problem to be differentiable as required by methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent. 
# Ant Colony Optimization
The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a technique that can be used to find optimal solution to problems that can be reduced to finding a good path (meeting certain criteria) through a graph. It is based on the pheromone based communication in ants and is modelled after an ant colony. In the code, we attempt to find an optimal solution for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the ACO Algorithm.
